SASS

Sass, or "Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets", is a language extension of CSS. It adds features that aren't available in basic CSS,
which make it easier for me to simplify and maintain the style sheets for my projects.

In this Sass course, I'll learn how to store data in variables, nest CSS, create reusable styles with mixins, add logic and loops to my styles, and more.
